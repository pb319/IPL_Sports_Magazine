## Problem Statement
**"Sports Basics"** is a sports blog company that entered space recently. They
wanted to get more traffic to their website by releasing a special edition magazine
on IPL 2024. This magazine aims to provide interesting insights and facts for
fans, analysts and teams based on the last 3 years' data.
The chief editor Tony Sharma oversees this publication, and he believes in data
analytics. He reached out to Peter Pandey, a journalist in his team who is a data-savvy cricket enthusiast.

## Data Loading
1. MySQL
- First I created a database called "ipl" using the following command

  ```CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS "ipl";```

- I used Mysql Workbench Table Data Import Wizard to import 
   - [fact_bowling_summary.csv](https://github.com/pb319/IPL_Sports_Magazine/files/14800053/fact_bowling_summary.csv)
   - [dim_match_summary.csv](https://github.com/pb319/IPL_Sports_Magazine/files/14800054/dim_match_summary.csv)
   - [dim_players.csv](https://github.com/pb319/IPL_Sports_Magazine/files/14800055/dim_players.csv)
   - [fact_bating_summary.csv](https://github.com/pb319/IPL_Sports_Magazine/files/14800056/fact_bating_summary.csv)

![01](https://github.com/pb319/IPL_Sports_Magazine/assets/66114329/2f5c505a-73e5-471b-8489-94c8c45a0b34)

Similarly, I added all other dimensions and fact tables into the Mysql Workbench:

  ![02](https://github.com/pb319/IPL_Sports_Magazine/assets/66114329/b3cd8eaf-1955-4840-88a6-707ba121d2f9)

The table names have been changed slightly using Mysql Workbench using the following bunch of code:
```
USE ipl;

ALTER TABLE dim_match_summary
RENAME TO  dim_match;

ALTER TABLE fact_bating_summary
RENAME TO  fact_bating;

ALTER TABLE fact_bowling_summary
RENAME TO  fact_bowling;
```
Connecting Mysql Database with **Power BI**:

## Data Exploration

1. Mysql

```
-- Data Exploration

	-- dim_match
		SELECT * FROM dim_match LIMIT 5; 
        DESC dim_match; 
		SELECT COUNT(match_id) as No_of_Matches,  
		COUNT(DISTINCT(team1)) as No_of_Teams, 
		COUNT(DISTINCT(RIGHT(matchDate,4))) as `Year` 
		FROM dim_match; 
        -- Therefore 10 teams participated in 206 matches
	
	-- Let's have a look into the margin column
			select DISTINCT(
			CASE 
				WHEN margin LIKE "%run%" THEN RIGHT(margin,4)
				WHEN margin LIKE "%wicket%" THEN (RIGHT(margin,7)) END) AS Margin
			FROM dim_match;
            -- that is We have 4 different in the form of singular and plural

	-- dim_players
		SELECT * FROM dim_players LIMIT 5; 
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(name)) as Player_Name, 
		COUNT(DISTINCT(team)) as No_of_Teams 
		FROM dim_players; 
        -- Data validation: Total Teams = 10, Total Number of Players 292

	-- fact_bating
		SELECT * FROM fact_bating LIMIT 5; 
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(match_id)) as No_of_Matches, 
		COUNT(DISTINCT(batsmanName)) as Batsman_Count 
		FROM fact_bating;
        -- Data Consistency: Total Matches played  = 206, Total Number of Batsman is 262
		
	-- fact_bowling
		SELECT * FROM fact_bowling LIMIT 5; -- 5 Rows of `fact_bowling` table
		
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(match_id)) as No_of_Matches, 
		COUNT(DISTINCT(bowlerName)) as Bowler_Count 
		FROM fact_bowling; 
        -- AGAIN Corraboration of Total Matches played  = 206
        -- Total Number of Bowlers 202

## Data Cleaning
1. Mysql 
  - There were some issues with "May 28-29, 2023" entry in the matchYear field while changing the datatype of matchDate column. Hence the following SQL command has been employed to manupulate the data a bit:
    ```
      set sql_safe_updates =0;
      UPDATE dim_match
      SET matchDate = 'May 29, 2023'
      WHERE matchDate = 'May 28-29, 2023';
      set sql_safe_updates =1;
    ```
1. Power BI

- "matchDate" datatype has been changed from text into Date:
   ```
    = Table.TransformColumnTypes(ipl_dim_match,{{"matchDate", type date}})
   ```
- "matchYear" column added:
   ```
   = Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type", "matchYear", each Date.Year([matchDate]), Int64.Type)
   ```

## Primary Data Analysis:
1. Mysql (Validated by Power BI Dashboar in the background)
  - Top 10 batsmen based on past 3 years total runs scored
```
	-- Primary Analysis
	-- ** Caution  Edit-> Preferences-> SQL Editor -> read-timeout interval to be at least 60 seconds **

	USE ipl;  -- (ASSIGNING DEFAULT TABLE) MUST RUN CODE ELSE REST WILL NOT WORK
	SELECT  DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(runs) DESC) as Player_Rank, 
    	batsmanName as Player_Name, SUM(runs)as Total_Run 
	FROM fact_bating
	GROUP BY batsmanName

## The Orange and Purple Cap Prediction
Here in this section, we will deal with various machine learning models and Statistical analysis to optimize those models mostly deployed through R and Python as a part of our "Predictive Analytics".

## Orange Cap:
#### __Objective__: 
- To predict the player having maximum total run in the IPL season 2024.

#### __Methodologies__: 
- Assumptions like _**Independence of errors, Normality of errors**_, etc. have been checked using various plots and measures.
- Primary model has been made through _**Stepwise Regression method**_.
- _**Multicollinearity**_ of independent variable has been identified by _**Variance Inflation Factor**_
- _**Multicollinearity**_ of the independent variable has been addressed by _**Principal Component Analysis**_
- _**Test of Significance**_ has been considered while model building
- Reliability has been reconfirmed by _**R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared**_

## Purple Cap:
#### __Objective__: 

- To predict the player with the most wickets in the IPL season 2024.

#### __Methodologies__: 

- The approach mentioned earlier for "Orange Cap Prediction" has been imitated.

## My Team 11

1. Power BI
- Data Analysis
	- I Classified the pool of players into various homogeneous groups (like Opener, Middle Order, Lower Order, etc.)
	- To classify some criteria are needed. I got it from Analysis using Power BI.
   	- Illustration: Say we want to make criteria for openers then:
   	  	1. Filter the pool using position 1,2. We can't allow middle-order players to play the role of opener.
   	  	2. Then Line Charts would depict 90 percentile points which may help us to put a cap for further filtering like Strike Rate, Average Ball Faced, etc.
   	  	3. Ordering players based on Standard Deviation of runs/Strike Rate/anything else may help choose the right ones.
